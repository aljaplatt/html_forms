What is a HTML Form?

The form element is a shell container that contains interative controls for submitting information.

The action attribute specifies where the form data should be sent when submitted - for example www.myserver.com or www.amazon.com

When you submit the form a HTTP request is sent.

The Method attribute specifies which HTTP method you would like to use.

The input element is used to create different form controls... theres over 20!

The type attribute is where the magic happens. Changing the type can dramatically alter the input behaviour and appearance. 

Types include : text, password, color number range time/date  - These all affect the input type the user can use.

The label represents a caption and is associated with an item in the user interface. They're really important for accessiblity as the label and its associated item
are linked behind the scenes and this is important for users who rely on screen readers, so the screen reader knows taht the text is associated with the input.

If someone is using a screen reasder the screen reader knows exactly what thext belongs to the input 

This link is made using the ID attribute on the input element.

Then we use the FOR attribute on the label -- YOU MUST USE THE SAME VALUE FOR EACH!
